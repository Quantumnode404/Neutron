AI-Powered Cognitive Data on Blockchain

*Concept*

NeuroLedger is an AI-driven platform that unlocks the potential of cognitive data without relying on physical devices. Instead of EEG wearables, it uses advanced AI algorithms to analyze user behavior, engagement, and other digital footprints to infer cognitive patterns. This data is tokenized on the blockchain, allowing users to securely own, monetize, or leverage it for personalized insights and AI model training.
